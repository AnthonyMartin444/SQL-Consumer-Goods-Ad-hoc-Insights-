Welcome to the **Comprehensive SQL Data Analysis Project** repository! 🚀  

This project demonstrates my ability to work with complex SQL queries to extract actionable insights, optimize processes, and support data-driven decision-making in a simulated business environment.  

## 📑 Project Overview  

In this project, I tackled various data analysis challenges using SQL. The tasks span across multiple domains such as customer segmentation, revenue analysis, product performance evaluation, and more. Key highlights include:  

- **Customer Analysis:** Identified unique markets in APAC and analyzed trends for Atliq Exclusive customers.  
- **Product Insights:** Evaluated year-over-year changes in product offerings and ranked top-performing product segments.  
- **Revenue Analysis:** Analyzed revenue contribution by channels and visualized quarterly sales trends.  
- **Cost Optimization:** Identified products with the lowest and highest manufacturing costs.  
- **Sales Trends:** Explored booking behaviors, seasonal patterns, and customer preferences.
